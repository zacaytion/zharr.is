### Hello, World! 

After a few years working as a programmer, I decided it's finally time to have my own blog. My goal is to write about programming and technology, mostly as a way to assist and document my learning. However I may explore other topics for fun.

Ideally I want to post every other week, but we'll see if I can keep up that pace. 

Look for a new post explaining how I built this blog in a few days time!
